As AI techniques become more and more powerful, reaching amazing results, such as image and text generation, it is more than ever necessary to build tools able to distinguish what is real from what is fake.\n","\n","Here we focus on a small portion of the whole fact checking problem, which aims to determine whether a given statement (fact) conveys a trustworthy information or not. \n","\n","More precisely, given a set of evidences and a fact to verify, we would like our model to correctly predict whether the fact is true or fake.\n","\n","In particular, we will see:\n","\n","*   Dataset preparation (analysis and pre-processing)\n","*   Problem formulation: multi-input binary classification\n","*   Defining an evaluation method\n","*   Simple sentence embedding\n","*   Neural building blocks\n","*   Neural architecture extension"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"hGDwg78PS_uy"},"source":["# The FEVER dataset\n","\n","First of all, we need to choose a dataset. In this assignment we will rely on the [FEVER dataset](https://fever.ai).\n","\n","The dataset is about facts taken from Wikipedia documents that have to be verified. In particular, facts could face manual modifications in order to define fake information or to give different formulations of the same concept.\n","\n","The dataset consists of 185,445 claims manually verified against the introductory sections of Wikipedia pages and classified as ```Supported```, ```Refuted``` or ```NotEnoughInfo```. For the first two classes, systems and annotators need to also return the combination of sentences forming the necessary evidence supporting or refuting the claim."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4Oa5FpVpT7p4"},"source":["## 2.1 Dataset structure\n","\n","Relevant data is divided into two file types. Information concerning the fact to verify, its verdict and associated supporting/opposing statements are stored in **.jsonl** format. In particular, each JSON element is a python dictionary with the following relevant fields:\n","\n","*    **ID**: ID associated to the fact to verify.\n","\n","*    **Verifiable**: whether the fact has been verified or not: ```VERIFIABLE``` or ```NOT VERIFIABLE```.\n","    \n","*    **Label**: the final verdict on the fact to verify: ```SUPPORTS```, ```REFUTES``` or ```NOT ENOUGH INFO```.\n","    \n","*    **Claim**: the fact to verify.\n","    \n","*    **Evidence**: a nested list of document IDs along with the sentence ID that is associated to the fact to verify. In particular, each list element is a tuple of four elements: the first two are internal annotator IDs that can be safely ignored; the third term is the document ID (called URL) and the last one is the sentence number (ID) in the pointed document to consider.\n","\n","**Some Examples**\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Verifiable**\n","\n","```\n","{\"id\": 202314, \"verifiable\": \"VERIFIABLE\", \"label\": \"REFUTES\", \"claim\": \"The New Jersey Turnpike has zero shoulders.\", \"evidence\": [[[238335, 240393, \"New_Jersey_Turnpike\", 15]]]}\n","```\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Not Verifiable**\n","\n","```\n","{\"id\": 113501, \"verifiable\": \"NOT VERIFIABLE\", \"label\": \"NOT ENOUGH INFO\", \"claim\": \"Grease had bad reviews.\", \"evidence\": [[[133128, null, null, null]]]}\n","```\n","\n","---"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"nex_8UM4VWuY"},"source":["## 2.2 Some simplifications and pre-processing\n","\n","We are only interested in verifiable facts.
